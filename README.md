## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository

```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resources-web.git
cd resources-web
```

2. Install dependencies

Choose your preferred package manager:

```shellscript
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

# Using bun
bun install
```

3. Start the development server

```shellscript
# Using npm

### 📦 Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```shellscript
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using yarn
yarn build

# Using pnpm
pnpm build

# Using bun
bun run build
```

### 🔍 Preview Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```shellscript

This updated "Getting Started" section now provides instructions for multiple package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun), making it more versatile for different user preferences. It also includes additional sections for building and previewing the production version of the project, which can be helpful for users who want to deploy the site.

Remember to adjust the port number if your Astro configuration uses a different port than the default **4321**.
